# data_structure_code

This repository contains my problem solutions (supposedly all correct, except explicitly said otherwise) for my data structure course, and my personal implementation of a handful of data structures in C++. The course I took was CS0501H-03 at Shanghai Jiao Tong University; the teacher is L. Zhang.

Should you find any severe mistakes, please contact me via ``zhijie dot chen at sjtu dot edu dot cn``.

*Remark: memory leaks are ignored in this repository, albeit this is not a good habit.*
