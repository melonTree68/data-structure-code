### data_structure_code

This repository contains my personal solutions (supposedly all correct, except explicitly said otherwise) to my data structure course, and my personal implementation of a handful of data structures in C++. The course I took was CS0501H-03 in Shanghai Jiao Tong University; the teacher is L. Zhang.
